    <p>
      Italian croissants and breakfast in a bar - Juls' KitchenA croissant is a
      French pastry, technically a type of viennoiserie, made from a
      yeast-leavened, laminated dough that creates a signature buttery, flaky,
      and airy texture. Inspired by the Austrian kipferl, croissants are made by
      repeatedly layering butter into the dough, a process called lamination,
      before the dough is rolled into a crescent shape and baked.
